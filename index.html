                <p>Elon Musk is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO and chief engineer
                    of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company;
                    co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; president of Musk Foundation; and owner of Twitter, Inc. With an
                    estimated net worth of around $210 billion as of October 27, 2022, Musk is the wealthiest person in the
                    world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's real-time billionaires list.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. He attended the University of Pretoria before moving
                    to
                    Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he
                    matriculated
                    at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's
                    degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but
                    decided
                    to instead pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother, Kimbal.
                    The
                    startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded the online bank
                    X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, and is its
                    CEO
                    and chief engineer. In 2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors,
                    Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the position
                    of
                    CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was later acquired by
                    Tesla
                    and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company promoting friendly
                    artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on
                    developing
                    brain–computer interfaces, and he founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022,
                    Musk
                    purchased Twitter for $44 billion. He has proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system
                    and
                    is the president of the Musk Foundation, which donates to scientific research and education.</p>

                <p>Musk founded SpaceX that could build affordable rockets in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and
                    Chief Engineer. SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006. Though the rocket
                    failed to reach
                    Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA
                    Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant) Mike Griffin later that year. After two more
                    failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt, SpaceX succeeded in
                    launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008. Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion
                    Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon
                    spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011
                    retirement. In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial
                    spacecraft. Musk credited the NASA award, one of the last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA
                    Administrator, for saving the company.</p>

                    Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a
                    Falcon 9 on an inland platform. Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an
                    ocean-based recovery platform. In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission
                    carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload. Since 2019, SpaceX has been
                    developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9
                    and the Falcon Heavy. In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the
                    first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.</p>

                <p>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who
                    financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the
                    company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment
                    in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of
                    directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product
                    design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted
                    from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product
                    architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder,
                    along with Tarpenning and two others. As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any
                    automotive manufacturer globally. In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while
                    retaining his position as CEO.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it
                    was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. Tesla began
                    delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012. A cross-over, the Model X was launched in
                    2015. A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017. The Model 3 is the all-time
                    bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1
                    million units globally. A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020. The
                    Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019. Under Musk, Tesla has also
                    constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.</p>

                <p>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100
                    million. Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by
                    creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such technology
                    could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software. The company also hopes
                    to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia,
                    and spinal cord injuries</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human
                    brain. At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your
                    skull" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists
                    and publications criticized these claims, with MIT Technology Review describing them as
                    "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater". During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with
                    a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on Macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis'
                    Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game
                    Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some
                    monkeys—have led to claims of anty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has
                    alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act. In 2022, Neuralink
                    announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year. Musk is listed as the sole
                    author of an October 2019 paper that details some of Neuralink's research, although Musk's being
                    listed as such rankled the Neuralink team's researchers.</p>

                <p>In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnelsrevealed plans for specialized,
                    underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour and thus circumvent
                    above-ground traffic in major cities.y in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory
                    bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m)
                    deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.Los
                    Angeles tunnel, less than two miles in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model X's
                    and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.</p>

                <p>In 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain—a vacuum tube train—and assigned a dozen
                    engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.            Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the hyperloop.alpha design for the
                    system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.document scoped out
                    the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the
                    Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion. The
                    proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any
                    other mode of transport for such long distances.equently, Musk biographer Ashlee Vance has
                    claimed that the original purpose of Musk's Hyperloop proposal was to thwart a high-speed rail project
                    in California.

                <br>
                <p>In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate
                    on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in
                    January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne airport
                    as its destination. In July 2017, Musk claimed that he had received "verbal government approval" to
                    build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in both Philadelphia and
                    Baltimore. Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website
                    in 2021.

                <p>Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter
                    Rive founded in 2006. By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in
                    the United States. In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production
                    facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.
                    Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture
                    with Panasonic until early 2020.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla
                    Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time,
                    SolarCity was facing liquidity issues. Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and
                    Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at
                    the expense of Tesla and its shareholders. Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January
                    2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant. Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's
                    favor.</p>

                <p>In 2015, Musk founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to
                    develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity. A
                    particular focus of the company is to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against

                    with his role as CEO of Tesla as the latter company increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla
                    Autopilot. Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural
